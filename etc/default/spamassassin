ENABLED=1

# Options
# See man spamd for possible options. The -d option is automatically added.

# Instead of using a TCP socket, listen on a UNIX socket. This allows us to
# limit access to specific users (to prevent all users from being able to use
# the TELL command to learn new spam/ham messages). By allowing access to the
# spamd-access group, specific users (i.e., the users exim and dovecot are
# running as) are given permission.
SOCKET="--socketpath=/var/run/spamd.socket --socketowner=nobody --socketgroup=spamd-access --socketmode=0660"

# SpamAssassin uses a preforking model, so be careful! You need to
# make sure --max-children is not set to anything higher than 5,
# unless you know what you're doing.
OPTIONS="--create-prefs --max-children 5 --helper-home-dir $SOCKET"

# Pid file
# Where should spamd write its PID to file? If you use the -u or
# --username option above, this needs to be writable by that user.
# Otherwise, the init script will not be able to shut spamd down.
PIDFILE="/var/run/spamd.pid"

# Set nice level of spamd
#NICE="--nicelevel 15"

# Cronjob
# Set to anything but 0 to enable the cron job to automatically update
# spamassassin's rules on a nightly basis
