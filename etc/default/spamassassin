# There may be security risks.

# Change to one to enable spamd
ENABLED=1

# Options
# See man spamd for possible options. The -d option is automatically added.

# Instead of using a TCP socket, listen on a UNIX socket. This allows us to
# limit access to specific users (to prevent all users from being able to use
# the TELL command to learn new spam/ham messages). By allowing access to the
# spamd-access group, specific users (i.e., the users exim and dovecot are
# running as) are given permission.
SOCKET="--socketpath=/var/run/spamd.socket --socketowner=nobody --socketgroup=spamd-access --socketmode=0660"

# Use -u nobody to always make spamd run as nobody. The default is to run as
# root and drop to the username given by the client. Since we don't use real
# users (usernames are name@domain.tld), this dropping never works and spamd
# falls back to using nobody already. So we give -u here to just skip the
# entire dropping business and just run as nobody from the start.
#
# Use --allow-tell to allow training messages using spamc. This removes the
# need for complex permission settings on the bayes database files, since now
# only spamd needs to access the bayes database.
#
# Use --nouser-config to not try to load configs from homedirs ("users" are not
# system users usually) and --sql-config to load preferences from SQL instead.
OPTIONS="--create-prefs --max-children 10 -u nobody --allow-tell $SOCKET --nouser-config --sql-config"

# Pid file
# Where should spamd write its PID to file? If you use the -u or
# --username option above, this needs to be writable by that user.
# Otherwise, the init script will not be able to shut spamd down.
PIDFILE="/var/run/spamd.pid"

# Set nice level of spamd
#NICE="--nicelevel 15"

# Cronjob
# Set to anything but 0 to enable the cron job to automatically update
# spamassassin's rules on a nightly basis
CRON=1
