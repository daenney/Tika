# This is the global sieve script for users without their own sieve scripts. If
# you edit this file, be sure to recompile it be running:
#
#   $ sudo sievec -c /dev/null /etc/dovecot/sieve/default
#
# -c /dev/null is to prevent sievec from dropping privileges. This is fixed in
# dovecot 2.1.9, see http://dovecot.org/pipermail/dovecot/2014-June/096737.html

# You'll also need to edit this same file in the web.local container, which
# should be identical to this file (minus this comment) and is used by
# roundcube.
