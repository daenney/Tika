# The PAM configuration file for the cron daemon

# cron uses pam_set_cred so it needs a working auth section. It does not do
# any other real authentication.

# pam_unix does general checks based on NSS info, so it also works for both
# local and ldap users.
#
# This does not include common-account, because
# that does extended LDAP checks, such as requiring SystemLoginIdentity
# and checking the host attribute, which isn't appropriate for system
# accounts running cron stuff.
